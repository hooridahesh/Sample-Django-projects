# Summary of the content of each project:
#### 🔸days_project:
This is my first project in Django, in which I show a list of days of the week, and if you click on each day, you will enter the page related to that list, which has details in the module of that day. Also, if instead of days of the week, a number between 1 and 7 is entered in the url after "day", it will automatically enter the days of the week, and if days other than the week are entered in the url, the message "This page does not exist" will be printed.  
This project did not pay much attention to styling and was only for initial practice.  
For more details, see the project and the main project file is also called "config".
#### 🔸Blog_project:
This is the second project.
On the first page, only two of the most recently added courses are shown, and if you click on "All Posts", all courses are shown, and finally, if you click on each course, the course details are shown.
This project has paid attention to styling to an acceptable extent.  
For more details, see the project and the main project file is called "blog_project".
